              Hello! My name is Harry Furusho and welcome to my portfolio site.
              Here you will find a page of projects that I've worked on, as well
              as how to contact me.
            </p>
            <p>
              A bit about myself: I graduated from the University of Washington
              with a Bachelor's of Science in applied physics. When I graduated,
              I was unsure if I wanted to have a career in physics and so I
              quickly got a job as a legal assistant through a roommate who had
              majored in political science. This was my first job and was a huge
              lesson in what kind of career I wanted. While law is interesting,
              I figured it wasn't for me. I then thought back to some of my
              favorite classes back in my undergrad and remembered how
              challenging but fun my programming classes were. So that brings
              things to now, where I am trying to further my knowledge of web
              development and make a career of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I enjoy going for runs, longboarding, exploring
              the Pacific Northwest, or just hanging out with my friends and
              family.
